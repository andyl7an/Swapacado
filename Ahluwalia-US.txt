Aalok Ahluwalia
As a freshman, I want to use my plus dollars on options other than campus dining, so that I can make the best use of my money.
As an upperclassman at Cal Poly, I want to enjoy the dining options on campus and not pay full price, so that I have more money in my budget.
As a freshman, I want to be able to trade my plus dollars, so that at the end of the year  I’m not forced to let them expire.
As a student, I want to be notified of plus dollars being traded around me, so that I don’t miss out on any trades.
